I am a 22 year old male named Ryan Rittner. I am about to enter my last year in school - I am going to be starting a 1 year masters program at Purdue University majoring in Computer Science focusing on AI/ML. I will be seeking full time employment in the coming year, ideally finding a job in or near a major city, preferably Chicago. I am from Wilmette, IL, though my family now lives in Lake Forest, IL. Both of these towns are Chicago suburbs. I am living with my girlfriend of 3 years, Ally, who graduated (along with me) this past spring from Purdue University. She majored in pre-med and is now taking a gap year working as a medical receptionist, and will be looking to go to Rad-tech school after. I love playing golf, as well as watching football (Bears fan), baseball (Cubs fan), and college basketball (Purdue fan). Things that I find important in emails are information about my schooling that pertains to me directly (I don't care as much about campus/department wide emails). Similarly, on the topic of job searching, anything that could be a genuine lead for me on a job is very important, but general "check out these jobs" emails from sites like linkedin or indeed are useful but less important. Any email that would expect a response is more important and more urgent. If an email is time sensitive, it is definitely urgent, and the longer ago i received it the more urgent it is, unless so much time has passed it isn't relevant anymore.
